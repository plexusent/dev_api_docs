### GET search endpoints

Returns matches of a term or criteria for movie, show, and contribution (director/cast) items.
These can be used for search features as well as AJAX autocomplete functionality.

* api/v3/search.json
* api/v3/search/movies.json
* api/v3/search/shows.json
* api/v3/search/contributors.json

__Note:__ Since the GoWatchIt database includes both movie AND television data, we will
refer to individual items as 'watchables'. Watchables currently include
movies and TV shows.

### GET api/v3/search

General search enpoint. Response will include top 5 results in each of the
following categories: movies, shows and contributors.

#### General parameters

   pg_ratings[]=pg-13
   ```
   - *run_time_min* - a watchable's minimum duration

#### Availability parameters

Allow customization of search results based on a watchable's current availability.

   - *provider_format_ids* - includes watchables in the specified GoWatchIt provider formats. For example,
   
   ```
   provider_format_ids[]=1
   ```
   
   will only include watchables available via Netflix Mail unless other availability parameters are specified.
   - *categories* - a list of availability categories. Search results will only include watchables available in the specified categories. 

   Valid values: 
      * *presale* (presale theater tickets are available)
      * *theater* (currently played in theaters) 
      * *online* (available for online streaming) and
      * *dvd* (available on DVD/Blu-Ray). For example, a search specifying
   ```
   categories[]=online
   ```
   will only include watchables available for streaming

#### Sorting
If a search term is supplied, the watchables will always be sorted by relevance. Otherwise, the watchables will be sorted by title in the ascending order. 


**Note on formatting collection URL parameters:**

__[ ]__ denotes parameters that can accept a collection of values. For
example, in order to retrieve watchables that are available for streaming
OR on dvd OR both, pass the *categories* like so

   ```
   categories[]=online&categories[]=dvd
   ```

The same pattern applies to all collection parameters such as
*provider_format_ids*, *genres*,*pg_ratings* etc.
