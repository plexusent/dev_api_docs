**Note About TV Availabilities**

Our television data is hierarchical in nature, with `Shows` having `Seasons` which have `Episodes`.
In rare cases, Shows may directly possess episodes, but typically they will belong to a season.

Each of the three levels may have their own availability records. For example, most availabitities are on the 
episode level, however iTunes has full "Season Passes" available for a one-time purchase. It's possible but not common
for a Show to have an availability.

Episode availabilities are __not__ considered availabilities of their parent show or season's API endpoint. 
(If this were the case, The Simpsons "show" endpoint would contain 525+ episodes).

To retrieve a Show's list of episodes, the client must first query `api/v3/shows/:id`, then read the available season ids shown. 
Next, the client should query `api/v3/seasons/:id` and retrieve the episode ids listed. 
Finally, the client may query specific episodes by id at `api/v3/episodes/:id`

These endpoints below have a special properties of direct and related availabilities:
 * `/api/v3/shows/:id`
 * `/api/v3/shows/:id/availabilities`
 * `/api/v3/seasons/:id`
 * `/api/v3/seasons/:id/availabilites`

A direct availabilities is, as described above, directly for that show or season.
A related availability is the lastest episode of the latest season. This is only shown when one is available.
The presence of any current direct or related availabilty will cause the `available` attribute to be true.
